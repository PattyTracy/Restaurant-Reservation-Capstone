# Branches
- Main
-       Worked on User Story #4 until 15/17 tests were passing
-       Had some odd things going on between local and remote repos. There were a lot of untracked changes after merging US-#5 to Main in GitHub. The problem seemed to be that the changes needed to be merged locally after a git pull request.
-       Completed functions for User Story #6.
-       Completed front-end functions for User Stories #2 and 3.
- db-connection:
-       created db's for dev, test, preview & prod & connected them
-       defined rows in "reservations" table
-       created "tables" table via Knex migrate
-       created seeds file for "tables"
-       seeded "reservations" table
-       confirmed that server runs and DBeaver is connected to db
- US-01: (for User Story #1)
-       created routes for /reservations/new and /reservations pages

-       continued testing User Story #1; 6 tests still not passing
-       imported 2 functions from front-end/utils/date-time.js 
        to complete GET functions for /reservations route
-       troubleshooting until all tests for US-#1 pass
-       completed 2 functions to validate that the date is in the
        future and is not a Tuesday when the restaurant is closed
- US-#3: (for User Story #3)
-       Writing middleware to confirm time is between 
        10:30-21:30 in "reservations"
-       Created "GET" route for "tables" (actually part of US-#4)
-       Updated "tables" to remove "seat" column and change
        properties of "reservation_id" to default to NULL value
- US-#4: (for User Story #4)
-       Continue working on User Story #4 tests
- US-#5: (for User Story #5)
-       Create DELETE request for /tables/:table_id/seat
-       Repaired corrupt migration files & fixtures/tables
- User#4: (for User Story #4)
-       Completed tests for User Story #4 tests
        by creating a link for the "reservation_id" in "tables"
- US-#6: (for User Story #6)
-       Created a new migration file to add a "status" column to the
        "reservations" table
-       Ran new migration in development, test, preview, and
        production environments
-       All environments are seeded with data
- rate:
        Added rate limiter function to app.js to resolve GitHub error/alert
- US-#7: (for User Story #7)
        Modified reservations.controller "list" function to check for a
        mobile_number query and if so, to use the given (from ReadMe) 
        "search" function in reservations.service to search for reservations 
        with a given phone number.
- US-#8: (for User Story #8)
- issues-#x: created to correct issues with User Stories 4, 5 and 6 that
        emerged after the back end files were completed. Also renamed 
        the "update" and "edit" functions in the reservations table
        to "updateStatus" and "update" for clarity.
- F-US-#1 (F for front end, User Story #1)
-       Wrote component NewReservation to create and save a new reservation. Also wrote a ReservationForm component that can be re-used that has the form with input fields. This can be used for create reservation, update reservation, and change status.
-        Created previous, today and next buttons on dashboard. They work locally but I'm unable to run tests.
- F-US-#2: (front end for User Story #2)
- F-Revising-1, 12/12/23: Still unable to run front-end tests. Test 1 on backend is now failing & needs to be fixed. 
Updated 1/2/24: all back-end unit tests passing.
Started working on user story 4, Seat Reservation. New tables function works but need to display tables on dashboard and add free/occupied status to each table. Also need seat button next to each reservation (add to ReservationView).
To run the front-end tests, try starting up the server on its own, letting it get warmed up, then running the front-end tests separately using the commands in /front-end/package.json file.
